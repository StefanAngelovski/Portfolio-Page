# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website made using **React JS** and **Bootstrap**.  
I recently ported it from jQuery, managing to make it a lot cleaner with less repetitive code, as React allows for the use of components. All the pictures are hosted via **Cloudinary**.

The website was upgraded from using **Owl-Carousel** for jQuery to **React-Slick**, which is much easier to work with.

### Features

#### Neon Look
I was inspired by the **retrowave** style, which draws on **futurism**, perfectly describing my projects.

#### Modals
I'm particularly proud of the modals, especially the **technologies modal**, which can be triggered via two buttons.  
A large rectangle with a gradient rotates around, with the edges of the modal removed, giving it a unique **neon animation**.

#### Animated Buttons
I've added **hover animations** to some of the buttons, further emphasizing the retrowave style.  
The modals feature a rotating rectangle with a gradient cut using the inset property for a dynamic look.

#### Responsive Design
The site is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

#### Colourful Scrollbars
The website features **cyan scrollbars** that work across most browsers. It's a small detail, but it really adds a pop of color!

### React-Slick Carousel
The website also includes a carousel with **category filtering** for different project types (e.g., Web Dev, Electronics, Mobile, Software, etc.).

### Contact Information & CV
The website provides ways to **contact** me, along with social media links. You can also **download my CV** directly from the site.
